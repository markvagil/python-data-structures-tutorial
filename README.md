# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to my tutorial on 3 different data structures using Python. Every programmer should understand each one of these and be able to use them well.

- [Stack](stack/1-stack.md)
- [Linked Lists](linkedlist/2-linked_list.md)
- [Tree](tree/3-tree.md)

Each module contains an explanation of the data structure, with an example problem, and finally a problem for you to solve on your own. My solution to that problem is also included if you are unable to complete your own solution.
