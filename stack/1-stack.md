# Stack

Stacks are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming. They are commonly known as arrays, or as lists in python. they operate under the "last in, first out" principle. This means that elements are added to the top of the stack using a "push" function, and later removed using a "pop" function. All kinds of data can be used in a stack, such as functions, objects, variables, etc.

## Example Problem

For our example, we will pretend that we are car dealership. We need to keep track of our inventory of vehicles that we have on the lot. We can do this using a stack, which is a list in python. In our list, we can create a "car" object which can contain information about the vehicle such as color, mileage, make, model, and year. We can add each of these "car" objects into our list and see all of the vehicles that we have in stock and their details from a glance.

## Student Problem

Now it's your turn to solve a problem using lists. For this problem we have been given a list of words. Our job is to put them together into a sentence. The words are already in the correct order, we just have to concatenate all of them and print out the result.
